# Fashion_MNIST_Classifier

#**Objective:**
The goal is to build a multiclass classification model using Keras with TensorFlow backend to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

**Dataset Description:**
Fashion MNIST consists of 70,000 images, where:
<li> 60,000 images are for training </li>
<li>10,000 images are for testing</li>
Each image belongs to one of 10 classes:
T-shirt, topTrouser, Pullover, DressCoat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot

**Dependencies:**
tensorflow : For building and training the neural network.
sci-kit learn: For data preprocessing. train_test_split
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: For numerical computations.
